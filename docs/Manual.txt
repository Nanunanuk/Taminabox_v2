1) Install Raspbian on the Pi
2) Control of Raspi via SSH or Remote-desctop
3) Using installation instruction from codingworld
4) Setting SPI to former version:
	git clone https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py.git
	git checkout 8cce26b9ee6e69eb041e9d5665944b88688fca68
	sudo python setup.py install
5) Changing SCK port in MFRC522.py from 22 to 11 and changing print 'text' to print('text') in all relevant documents of the MFRC522 folder

6) Setting up a shared network drive using samba (https://www.patrickweber.info/raspberry-pi-netzwerk-ordner-teilen-mit-windows/)

7) 


The python script MyRead_v3.py is automatically started with the startup of the system.
	The script needs to be included in the /etc/rc.local with help of sudo nano /etc/rc.local
	Here is the complete code of that file:
	
	#!/bin/sh -e
	#
	# rc.local
	#
	# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
	# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
	# value on error.
	#
	# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
	# bits.
	#
	# By default this script does nothing.

	# Print the IP address
	_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
	if [ "$_IP" ]; then
	  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
	fi
	python /home/pi/SPI-Py/MFRC522-python/MyRead_v3.py &
	(/etc/rpi-pc_shutdown.sh)&
	exit 0
	
If the script is running can be checked with:
	ps aux | grep -i python
If the script is running the PID (Process ID) is the first number behind in the line.
To stop the script just write the PID behind the this command:
	sudo kill
